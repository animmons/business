				<p>This would be a paragraph about the history of the company. Maybe it would describe the inception of the idea, a little about the founders of the company, where the tea comes from and where the tea is actually made. It would be an interesting blurb that doens't contain a lot of details, because assumingly, we would want you to click on the link below to read more about the company. <br>

		<h4> Our Mission </h4> 
			<img src="images/tea2.jpg" width='266' height='180.75'/>
				<p> Here we would describe how great how tea is and how dedicated we are to providing the best possible product. It might casually list benefits and positive attributes of the tea in order to convince you how much we care about you through this product. It might also contain a catchy slogan or a slightly repetitive saying that represents our brand, without being too wordy.</p>
